	<h3><br>The Conflict Over Kashmir</h3>
	<p>By Vaibhav Kumar - September 11, 2016<br><br><br>
		<b>HISTORY ON THE INDIA PAKISTAN KASHMIR CONFLICT</b><br><br>

On August 14th 1947, British India was partitioned to India and Pakistan. Kashmir, an area of land that fell between Pakistan and India, was preoccupied by many ethnicities. It was broken down into three different areas: Ladakh (located in the northwest and with a majority Buddhist), Kashmir Valley (located in the middle and mainly Muslim), and Jammu (located in the south and primarily Hindu). Although Kashmir is quite diverse, a majority of the area is Muslim. The first arguments over the land began in 1948 because India believed that Kashmir should be part of India but Pakistan disagreed. The result of these arguments was the division of Kashmir to a Pakistani-controlled part and an Indian-controlled part. This dividing line is called the Line of Control (LoC). In 1972, India and Pakistan signed a peace agreement called Shimla which ensured that both countries would use nonviolent methods to resolve their feuds over the region. It also assured that neither country would try to change the Line of Control (LoC) developed in 1948.<br><br>

As the battles on the ground continued, India tested their first nuclear device in 1974, which directly caused Pakistan to accelerate investment in their nuclear weapons program. This event set off the arms race (continued proliferation of nuclear weapons) that India and Pakistan are facing today. The violence in Kashmir continued to rise throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Around the late 1990s and the early 2000s, the likelihood of nuclear battle continued to rise as both sides continued to arm themselves with nuclear weapons. In the early 2000s, a series of terrorist attacks continued to push both countries towards the brink of war. First on December 13 2001, a terrorist by Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed attack occurred on India’s parliament leaving fourteen people dead. Shortly after the attack, India retaliated by sending more military units to the border with Pakistan as well as the LoC. On May 14, another terrorist attack killed innocent Indian families. In response, India threatened to retaliate. To deter India from attacking, Pakistan threatened to use nuclear weapons if India sent troops to the LoC. The deterrence strategy worked and India did not retaliate. Although the situation has not gotten as serious as it was in 2002, Pakistan and India continue to fight in Kashmir as tensions still remain high over the disputed land.<br><br>

<b>IDENTIFICATION OF ACTORS</b><br><br>

The most obvious actors in this conflict would be India and Pakistan because of their self-interest in the region, but many other states and multilateral institutions got involved and are currently involved in this long-term struggle for Kashmir. In 1962, China had a war with India called the Sino-Indian war. As a result of the war, China got part of Ladakh which further divided the region. Throughout the conflict the U.N has stayed involved in many ways. They are the ones that passed a resolution giving two-thirds of the region to India and the other one-third to Pakistan. They have also tried to pass resolutions demanding for a cease-fire in the region. The United States has also been trying to remedy the issue as Obama traveled to India in 2010. Relations between Pakistan and India was one of the biggest talking points, especially Kashmir, during his historic visit.<br><br>

<b>CAUSES AND IDENTIFICATION OF THE CONTENTIOUS ISSUE</b><br><br>

To understand why the dispute over Kashmir is taking place, one must understand the intricate history between Pakistan and India. When both countries were freed in 1947, the citizens were given an option to join the Hindu India or the Muslim Pakistan. The ruler at the time, Maharaja Singh, did not back a country at the time which caused unrest on the Pakistani side. As a result, in October 1947 Pakistanis started using violence in Kashmir. Singh asked for the backing of India to calm this violence. India said they would only help Singh out if the land was given to them after the war – something Pakistan has failed to recognize ever since. A gruesome battle followed and finally in 1948, the U.N. passed a resolution giving two-thirds of the land to India and one-third of the land to Pakistan and also formed the Line of Control (LoC). Pakistan was not pleased with this resolution because they believed that since the land was mainly inhabited by Muslims they should have control of it. They suspected that the Indian government would treat the Muslims in their land with prejudice which is an argument the Pakistani government uses to this day. India was also left unpleased as they were promised all of the land if they came to the assistance of Singh. Therefore, the violence in the region continues to rise as both countries think that the land is part of their territory.<br><br>

<b>POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE</b><br><br>

<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/south_asia/03/kashmir_future/html/5.stm">Transform Kashmir into an Independent State</a> – This solution would require that both India and Pakistan give up their land in Kashmir and turn it over to a multilateral institution like the U.N. In this world, tensions would be reduced in the long-term as India and Pakistan are not sharing the Kashmiri border. This would mean a direct decrease in any border skirmishes and a reduction in the budged needed to protect the border. This would also appease the Kashmiri people, as a majority of these citizens have stated that they want independence. The possibility of India and Pakistan engaging in these peace discussions is remarkably low because neither country wants to just get rid of their own land.<br><br>

<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/south_asia/03/kashmir_future/html/">Formalize the LoC</a> – This method would result in both India and Pakistan having new borders. This recommendation has been discussed in great detail in the past as Pakistani leaders have been rumored to agree to this solution. In 2011, President Musharraf thought this was the way to resolve this long-lasting struggle between the two countries. The issue with this solution would be that Pakistanis would feel cheated on the deal as they only got one-third of the land while India got a majority of the land. It could also provoke some backlash from Indians, as some believe that the land is their right as they helped resolve the war that broke out in 1947.<br><br><br>
