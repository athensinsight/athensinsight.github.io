	<h3><br>Why All Lives Matter Logic is Flawed</h3>
	<p>By Ravi Parashar - September 18, 2016<br><br><br>
		11:00 AM, April 28, 2016, Baltimore, Maryland: convenience stores are on fire, police car windshields are shattered, the national guard is swarming into the city, protestors are hurling rocks and shouting slogans, while the media is filling with divided opinions. Some channels say they understand the protestors’ discontent, which was sparked by the death of Freddie Gray, an African American man, in police custody under suspicious circumstances. Other forms of media say that the rioters’ arguments are baseless and condemn the phrase, “black lives matter.”<br><br>

Black Lives Matter is a movement with no formal hierarchy and is largely decentralized, often staging protests after controversial events including killings of colored people by the police. This name was coined from hashtags which began trending on twitter after George Zimmerman, who killed Trayvon Martin, was acquitted in 2013 and gained nationwide recognition after the death of Michael Brown. This article aims to inform on the issue, given its extreme relevance, by laying out some common arguments against Black Lives Matter and responding to them.<br><br>

<b>Black Lives Matter is inherently racist because it emphasizes that one race is more important than another. All lives matter.</b><br><br>

No one said all lives do not matter; it is just the state of inequality between white and black citizens of America that must prompt us to focus on advancing the welfare of African Americans through government and social programs. Promoting equality for a specific group that is underprivileged in comparison to the majority is not racist. The argument that all lives matter almost confirms the existence of white privilege. The mere non-inclusion of white lives mattering in this slogan causes anger in egotistic white society, because stating that black lives matter somehow conveys to these individuals that white lives do not matter.<br><br>

While white privilege is not the only factor for individual success, there is no doubt that blacks in America are systemically treated badly due to the color of their skin. Black people comprised 13% and white people comprised 63% of the US population in 2012 but 31% of those killed by police during arrest were black and 52% were white. Moreover, 39% of those not attacking when killed are black people. <a href="http://www.jbwtucker.com/ultimate-white-privilege-statistics/">[1]</a> Often, when police killings of blacks are brought up, conservatives raise the issue of black on black violence. The obvious counterargument to this is that cops should be held to a higher standard than gangs, however, it should also be noted that white society led to the conception of the ghetto and the rise of gangs through their deprivation of black communities. In 2010, around 28% of blacks from age 18-25 years old had used marijuana in the past year while around 33% of whites in the same age group had used marijuana in the past year; however, the arrest rate for marijuana possession in 2010 was 700 per 100,000 people for blacks while it was 200 for every 100,000 people for whites. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/06/04/the-blackwhite-marijuana-arrest-gap-in-nine-charts/">[2]</a> In a University of Michigan study, it was shown that black defendants face significantly more severe charges than white ones, despite controlling for criminal behavior (arrest offense, criminal history, etc.). <a href="https://www.fjc.gov/public/pdf.nsf/lookup/NSPI201213.pdf/$file/NSPI201213.pdf">[3]</a><br><br>

These statistics depict a clear disparity between how policing methods and the justice system apply to white and black citizens. With these obstacles, it is significantly more difficult for an African American individual to succeed than it is for a Caucasian individual.<br><br>

<b>The African American culture is innately uncivil.</b><br><br>

The Kerner Commission stated that, “[w]hat white Americans have never fully understood—but what the Negro can never forget—is that white society is deeply implicated in the ghetto. White institutions created it, white institutions maintain it, and white society condones it.” <a href="http://nocache.therealnews.com/t2/component/content/article/425-richard-rothstein/2383--from-ferguson-to-baltimore-the-fruits-of-government-sponsored-segregation-">[4]</a> The ghettoization of African American communities has happened subtly through government programs in the 19th and 20th centuries. The segregation of blacks after their release from slavery by the US government led to a domino effect.<br><br>

Existing black neighborhoods were considered underdeveloped, unsafe, and unstable for property values and thus were separated from white neighborhoods by government policies. Black people were barred from entering white neighborhoods by government policies and communal pressure. White homeowners were also punished for selling to colored people. The Federal Housing Administration refused to grant mortgages to white neighborhoods with black residents or black neighborhoods. When black people started migrating to urban areas due to a lack of housing, white people flocked out of the area in fear of having black neighbors. Realtors encouraged them to move into multi-family housing, where they would be crammed into small spaces. Husbands and wives worked double shifts to make ends meet during these times, often neglecting basic maintenance. Schools had to make special accommodations in these overcrowded neighborhoods by making half of the students go to school in the morning and half of them go in the afternoon. This deprived the children of a proper education. All of these conditions combined to create gangs and high crime rates and the effects of these policies continue to terrorize inner-city areas and hinder the black community from tangible progress. <br><br>

<b>BLM is a violent, divisive, and anti-police movement.</b><br><br>

No movement has been started by a minority group that has been initially accepted by the mainstream; for example, the civil rights movement, the women’s suffrage movement, and the LGBT movement. When these movements began they had little mainstream support, however, due to their effective leadership, they were able to achieve at least some of their goals.<br><br>

The Black Lives Matter movement is not anti-police, but instead wants better policing techniques and a more just judicial system as the status quo is clearly prejudiced towards African Americans. Only 54 police officers have been indicted for killing a civilian since 2005, yet some still claim that there is no evidence of corruption. As soon as news breaks of a black person killed by a cop, conservatives search for any excuse to implicate the colored person, often saying that they should have been compliant with the police. They ignore the obvious fact that everyone should cooperate with law enforcement and the fact that minorities are sometimes murdered despite being unarmed and compliant, the punishment for disobeying a police order should not immediately be death. Urban areas typically have far greater crime rates than suburban areas and thus the residents look to law enforcement for safety, but when they cannot trust police officers to be unbiased, it creates a large rift between these two parties.<br><br>

Better police training, an unbiased judicial system, body cameras, sensitivity and reform in the area of mental health issues are vital. Of course, there are situations in which police have no option but to shoot, however data suggests that there are many cases where the killing could have been avoided.<br><br>

When we see disturbing matters like police shooting civilians in the news, we must all take a step back and analyze the situation for ourselves, because the human aspect to this issue is very deep; friends and family alike are having their loved ones snatched from them every day for no apparent reason. Hopefully, as these facts begin to percolate throughout society, concrete change will come about soon.<br><br><br>
