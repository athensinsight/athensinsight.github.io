	<h3><br>Weakest Link in the Blockchain?</h3>
	<p>By Ravi Parashar - December 17, 2017<br><br><br>
		As Bitcoin’s value seems to surge higher and higher <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/12/bitcoin-shrugs-off-bubble-talk-and-surges-past-19000/">[1]</a>, an increasing number of people are questioning what exactly the cryptocurrency is and how it works. Technology is growing at a rapid rate, with new innovations that could greatly help society arriving many times a year. This ranges from advances in quantum computing <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/breaking-researchers-reveal-first-ever-complete-quantum-chip-architecture">[2]</a> to the sophistication of artificial intelligence <a href="https://astronomynow.com/2017/12/17/artificial-intelligence-nasa-data-used-to-discover-eighth-planet-circling-distant-star/">[3]</a>. One such breakthrough technology, the blockchain, is behind Bitcoin and related cryptocurrencies.<br><br>

Blockchain technology allows for digital information to be distributed instead of copied. Information stored on a blockchain exists as a scattered database which is constantly being verified. This structure has some benefits, such as keeping information public and verifiable and being difficult to hack since there is no centralized version of the information; furthermore, there can be no one party in control. The blockchain is easy to visualize in a Google Docs analogy <a href="https://blockgeeks.com/guides/what-is-blockchain-technology/">[4]</a>. Whereas before Docs, people had to send documents to one another and wait for the revised copy, they can now have access to the document and make changes at the same time. The shared ledger at the heart of blockchain is similar to this shared document.<br><br>

Some say the technology has the potential to revolutionize the global economy. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and other cryptocurrencies rely on it. The way these virtual currencies work is by storing confirmed transactions on the shared, public ledger. Locked data referred to as a private key signs a transaction and prevents the transaction from being altered. A process called mining confirms the transactions by storing them in a block on the blockchain that must adhere to several strict guidelines <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/how-it-works">[5]</a>. Bitcoin has been in existence for around 8 years and has only had minor failures thus far, all of which have been due to human error or hacking. This is promising, since it indicates that the underlying concept behind blockchain is sound.<br><br>

Items are given economic value if they are valued by people and Bitcoin is valued because, in short, it is popular. It has its value because other people use it; these people mainly find utility in its decentralization and its low taxability and traceability. However, cryptocurrency is still far from perfect. The volatility in the value of cryptocurrency <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-30/bitcoin-recovers-from-sudden-selloff-as-large-swings-persist">[6]</a>, multiple hacks which have resulted in the loss of millions of dollars worth of bitcoin <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/07/technology/nicehash-bitcoin-theft-hacking/index.html">[7]</a>, and the opinions of many economists who maintain that Bitcoin exists within a bubble <a href="https://investorplace.com/2017/11/the-bitcoin-bubble-its-not-different-this-time/">[8]</a>. Many also criticize Bitcoin for the extremely energy-intensive mining process, which creates more Bitcoin by solving increasingly complex math problems. The annual energy consumption used for Bitcoin is enough to power 3 million American homes. Even worse, most of this energy is generated from coal since the majority of Bitcoin mining is done in China <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/technology">[9]</a>.<br><br>

Bitcoin has potential to revolutionize digital transactions and make them more accessible in countries where the infrastructure for credit does not widely exist. The tech world is realizing that the extent of blockchain can reach beyond currency. There are many reasons blockchain will likely continue to grow in popularity. The value of privacy is rising sharply in a society where technology guarantees that you are never truly alone. The shared and constantly reconciled ledger offers some security. As countless technologies before it, blockchain will likely go through an awkward stage where it will be used in wasteful circumstances until we decide the optimal places for the technology to be utilized.<br><br>

Food safety is one of the seemingly unrelated areas in which blockchain is being applied. When tainted product is discovered, the product is taken off shelves everywhere, regardless of the supplier; however, with blockchain, the particular production line with the diseased product could be isolated. This would increase profits on the business end and protect customers from illnesses. Governments are looking into the applicability of blockchain tech in monitoring and controlling student loans and grants, as the current system is extremely complex. Cloud storage could utilize the shared ledger data structure so that even if one server malfunctions, the data will still be secure. One of the most interesting suggestions for using this technology is for connecting cars. Using blockchain would expedite the collection of driving data from thousands of cars so that safe and reliable self-driving cars can be developed. Some are even suggesting that blockchain may have utility in online voting in the future due to its absolute and transparent nature, although this is unlikely due to security concerns <a href="https://www.computerworlduk.com/galleries/security/how-could-blockchain-be-used-the-enterprise-3628558/">[10]</a>.<br><br>

In conclusion, although blockchain may seem like a miracle technology right now due to its popularity, it still has some major problems that must be figured out. In terms of its role in digital transactions, security issues must be resolved and transaction confirmation time must be shortened so cryptocurrencies can be used for mundane purchases. Society must also determine where blockchain can best be used while also optimizing it for these situations. Nonetheless, the future of this technology looks very promising.
