	<h3><br>Causes and Effects of the Iraq War</h3>
	<p>By Vaibhav Kumar - October 24, 2016<br><br><br>
		<b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2tbpUqNwRU">CAUSES OF THE IRAQ WAR</a></b><br><br>

On <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2010/08/31/world/">March 20, 2003</a> President George W. Bush formally announced the start of a war in Iraq. This war had begun for a multitude of reasons. After the horrific events that took place after 9/11, many Americans were frightened that another attack on their homeland would take place. In Iraq, Saddam Hussein, the brutal dictator, for thirty years was the center of instability in the Middle East and possibly the United States in the future. The Bush administration believed that planting the seeds of democracy in Iraq would cause a ripple effect where other neighboring countries like Syria, Jordan, Iran, and Saudi Arabia would install a democracy. They also claimed that with the spread of democracy, extreme ideologies such as terrorism would also decline. The administration supposed that with the birth of democracies in these areas, Saddam Hussein would lose his capability to the rule in the area.<br><br>

The Bush administration gave this much credence to Hussein because of his violent, erratic past.  In the Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988), Hussein led the Iraqi charges against the Iranians. In this battle almost one million individuals died. Furthermore, in this elongated war, both sides regularly used chemical weapons, a weapon of mass destruction. After the war, instead of rebuilding his weakened country he led a charge to invade Kuwait (August 1990), a country with excess oil. This resulted in the infamous Operation Desert Storm which lasted three weeks between the January and February of 1991. A United States lead-coalition which included countries like the United Kingdom and France defeated the Iraqis with much ease.<br><br>

As a result, Hussein still thought that his army had a chance of defeating the United States. In addition to making this bold statement, Hussein began to boast about his possession of weapons of mass destruction. The United States had little reason to not believe him, especially after the common use of these weapons in the Iran-Iraq War as well as the volatile behavior Hussein showed.<br><br>

After these comments, the United Nations continued to pass resolutions such as resolution 687 which required Iraq to destroy all ballistic missiles with a range longer than 150 kilometers. Hussein did not follow any of these resolutions and continued to act unilaterally in the region. He attempted to shoot down British and American war planes over the <a href="https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/no-fly_zone">no fly zone</a> (this is a designated area where planes cannot fly and if they do so they have the possibility of being caught or taken down) and continued to harbor terrorism in the region. One of the biggest actions he pursued was the expelling of UN weapon inspector which added to the suspicion western countries had on Iraq’s weapons program. This distrust of the Iraqis was only supercharged after the 9/11 terrorist attacks because no one wanted WMDs getting in the hands of terrorist groups. Using this intelligence, many democrats including Joe Biden, Hilary Clinton, and John Kerry supported this war and thus Bush had begun the Iraq War in 2003.<br><br>

<b>IDENTIFICATION OF ACTORS</b><br><br>

The most obvious actors in this conflict would be the United States and Iraq because of the declaration of war, but many other states and multilateral institutions got involved in this dynamic dilemma. The involvement of Iran in the Iran-Iraq War in 1980s was the basis of the uncertainty western countries had regarding Iraq when it came to the possession of nuclear weapons. Because of this battle and the use of chemical weapons the United States had believed what Hussein had said when he claimed that he owned nuclear weapons. Moreover, the invasion and involvement of Kuwait furthered the narrative of Hussein’s unreasonable leadership expertise. Breaching another country’s sovereignty is already disavowed by international law, but raiding another country right after a decade-long war which resulted in extreme instability regionally is wholly incoherent with international law. This bolstered the claim of Hussein’s preposterous leadership in Iraq which also lead many domestic politicians like Clinton and Biden to believe the claims that he kept nuclear weapons with him. Along with the Middle Eastern country involvement, a plethora of European countries were involved in the 2003 Iraq War itself. Nations such as the <a href="http://www.findthedata.com/">United Kingdom, Poland, Italy and Georgia</a> were involved in the warfare.<br><br>

<b><a href="https://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/world-report/2013/03/21/the-deeply-mixed-results-of-the-iraq-wars">EFFECTS OF THE IRAQ WAR</a></b><br><br>

            The goal of the Iraq War was to overthrow Hussein and as a result structure a democracy in Iraq. Along with this the United States wanted to not only find any nuclear weapons in the region but also stop the spread of terrorism. There were many positive and negative results of this war in Iraq. As a result of the war, the United States was able to ensure that there were no nuclear weapons in the region and that in fact Hussein was lying. They were also able to find and capture Sadam Hussein in Tikrit, Iraq. This helped in the death of Hussein when he was hung by Shi’te Muslims for Hussein’s crimes against humanities. As there were positives to this war, there was plenty of negatives as well. Most notably, was the <a href="https://thinkprogress.org/5-reasons-the-u-s-is-worse-off-because-of-the-iraq-war-391985251657/#.a9xw5rpe5">cost</a> of the Iraq War put America into major debt problems. The original estimates of the war were 50-60 billion dollars but the total amount ended up totaling 2.2 trillion dollars. This amount of money put a lot of stress on United States debt as well as the economy. Secondly, the war had exacerbated the issue of terrorism instead of resolving it. The power vacuum that resulted after the fall of Hussein and the United States’ inability to fill that void led to the expansion of terrorist groups. Not only were terrorist groups like Al-Qaeda strengthened but it also allowed for the harboring of new terrorist groups such as AQI (Al-Qaeda in Iraq).<br><br>

<b>IDENTIFICATION OF THE CONTENTIOUS ISSUE</b><br><br>

To understand why this dispute between the United States and Iraq was so contentious, one must understand the relationship America had with Hussein as well as the action in the region. It all began with the Iran-Iraq war where the weapons of mass destruction (chemical weapons) were first used. This was the original reason why the United States had begun to doubt Iraq. Shortly after this lengthy war, Hussein took his country to invade Kuwait which was yet another irrational action by the government in control of Iraq. A continuous inability to follow the United Nation’s resolutions about ballistic missiles as well as weapons of mass destruction only increased this suspicion. While Hussein was not following these resolutions he would continuously threaten the United States and many other nations by claiming he had nuclear weapons. All of these factors in addition to the recent terrorist attack on United States soil was enough to convince politicians to invade Iraq because they did not want weapons of mass destruction getting into the wrong hands especially after 9/11.<br><br>

<b>POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS</b><br><br>

<a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/al-qaeda-winning-hearts-minds-over-isis-yemen-social-services-2346835">Socio-Economic Support</a> – As a result of the war in Iraq, local economies have gotten destroyed and terrorism has exponentially increased in the region. These two results go hand in hand – many terrorist groups will often help the local individuals by distributing food, water, and other basic necessities, which reinforces the perception that they will aid the devastated community. These groups just demand that you join their organization to benefit their cause and as a result they will provide the locals with jobs, homes, and a future in return. This quid pro quo relationship is often the reason that terrorist recruitment is most successful in poorer areas because of the desperation these people face. When General Dempsey was asked how to defeat terrorist organizations he said “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/08/06/annotated-transcript-the-aug-6-gop-debate/">There is no military solution. We need to change the conditions on the ground so that young men are not in poverty and susceptible to radicalization.</a>” To resolve the issue of the terrorism, the United States must be able to help the Iraqi economy so these innocents are not susceptible to joining these terrorist organizations in the first place. Furthermore, if they have the basic human necessities from the United States they will not see the United States as an evil country that dismantled and destabilized Iraq but a country that is invested in the bettering of the nation by helping the local economy and people. This change in mindset and change in lifestyle would dramatically decrease the amount of terrorist recruitment happening in the area in the status quo.<br><br><br>
