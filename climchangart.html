	<h3><br>Donald Trump's Relationship With Climate Change</h3>
	<p>By Vaibhav Kumar - April 3, 2017<br><br><br>
		After the election of President Trump, many liberals were concerned about the future of this administration’s policies in relation to climate change. What would happen to this planet as carbon dioxide rates continuously increased at exponential levels? Scientist throughout the vast community have claimed for years that not only is climate change real but it is also anthropogenic. In addition, there are is an exceeding amount of science that claims that climate change will result in the extinction of the human race. The question still remains – if the science clearly points at one side being factual why is this existential phenomenon given such little attention?<br><br>

The United States had to do something to begin to resolve this dangerous dilemma. Thankfully it did – progress was made under the Obama presidency with the signing of the <a href="http://unfccc.int/paris_agreement/items/9485.php">Paris Agreement</a>, <a href="https://www.epa.gov/energy-independence">the Clean Power Plan</a>, <a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-releases-first-ever-standards-cut-methane-emissions-oil-and-gas-sector">cutting methane emissions</a> and <a href="https://www.climaterealityproject.org/blog/thanks-obama-five-ways-us-leading-world-climate-change">many other policies</a>.  Global warming wasn’t resolved in its entirety by the end of the Obama presidency. It would be utopian to expect a president to resolve all the harms of global warming – an issue that has been accumulating for hundreds of years in eight years. Although these policies didn’t resolve the dispute perfectly it set up the foundation and the stepping stones for future administrations to effectively tackle and restore the well-being of our planet. That is until the American people elected a president that believes that “The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.”<br><br>
		
In defense to the infamous tweet Trump put out, he wasn’t running for public office in that time – opinions change and that is completely a fair claim to make. Sadly, there has been a plethora of evidence that Trump still continues to not only prioritize issues like defense and homeland security over global warming but also believes that climate change isn’t a perilous concern. To begin, the budget that Trump released proposes a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/16/white-house-seeks-to-cut-epa-budget-31-as-trump-targets-regulation.html">31% cut</a> to the Environmental Protection Agency. The outcome of this cut will result in the release of nearly <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/16/white-house-seeks-to-cut-epa-budget-31-as-trump-targets-regulation.html">3,200 employees</a> (20% decrease) and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/budget-reflects-trumps-vow-to-cut-epa-in-almost-every-form/2017/03/15/0611db20-09a5-11e7-a15f-a58d4a988474_story.html?utm_term=.37455eaa719b">2.4 billion dollars</a> in spending for the agency.  In addition, to the quantitative decreases in employees and money circulating within the agencies, many programs will either be shut down or lose funding in the EPA. For example, many oil, natural gas, and coal companies are pleased with this budget proposal because it would result in a decrease of regulations for them. This would allow them to drill in unhealthy manners causing more destruction to the environment as there is would be no way to check them.<br><br>

This budget proposal would also call for a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/budget-reflects-trumps-vow-to-cut-epa-in-almost-every-form/2017/03/15/0611db20-09a5-11e7-a15f-a58d4a988474_story.html?utm_term=.37455eaa719b">cut of the Office of Research and Development Program</a>. This cut would be nearly half, leaving this department with 250 million dollars. Many cleanup projects will also be cut in this budget proposal such as the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/budget-reflects-trumps-vow-to-cut-epa-in-almost-every-form/2017/03/15/0611db20-09a5-11e7-a15f-a58d4a988474_story.html?utm_term=.37455eaa719b">Chesapeake Bay cleanup project being cut to zero dollars</a>. In conclusion, this bill will call for the elimination of “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/budget-reflects-trumps-vow-to-cut-epa-in-almost-every-form/2017/03/15/0611db20-09a5-11e7-a15f-a58d4a988474_story.html?utm_term=.37455eaa719b">more than 50 EPA programs</a>”. Among them, programs such as the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/03/07/this-federal-energy-program-is-good-for-the-climate-and-economy-trump-wants-to-kill-it-anyway/?tid=a_inl&utm_term=.ebecad909929">Energy Star Program</a>, which provides grants to help cities alongside states combat air pollution and overall boosts energy efficiency, will face the risk of extermination.<br><br>

Recently, Donald Trump has promised to repeal the <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/8/4/9096903/clean-power-plan-explained">Clean Power Plan</a>. This plan had a multitude of methods to solve global warming. To begin, the EPA would set emission goals for each state (this goal is found by a <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/8/4/9096903/clean-power-plan-explained">complex formula</a>). If states do not comply then the federal government will step in and implement a cap and trade plan. Undoing this would result in complications domestically and globally. The Clean Power Plan is one of the major methods in which the United States can keep on track with the promises made in the Paris Agreement – the first multilateral climate deal that included the world’s two largest polluters – China and the United States. Failing to comply with this will continue to destroy the planet and also set a major precedent that other countries do not have to follow this climate deal along with future climate deals. This precedent will prove to be extremely dangerous when future presidents and leaders of other countries try to combat climate change as a planet.<br><br>

Many would argue that some of these cuts will not actually happen because the budget Trump has proposed will not pass Congress. Although that is likely correct, it does ignore that policies such as the repealing of the crucial Clean Power Plan may still occur. In addition, this has set the blueprint of the budget. This will also further confirm the expectations many voters had about Trump in relation to global warming. Trump will continue to fight the clear science on global warming and threaten the health of the globe.<br><br>

Accepting global warming has become the norm, as it should be. Ignorance by one coalition doesn’t mean that a problem ceases to exist. The science is overwhelming – climate change is real and will have a great impact on future generations to come. We, as citizens have a question to ask ourselves now – will we let someone continue to destroy the home where our future generations will thrive or try to push back and revive our Earth?<br><br><br>
