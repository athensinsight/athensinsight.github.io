	<h3><br>Has the War on Drugs Been a Worthwhile Battle?</h3>
	<p>By Ravi Parashar - December 21, 2016<br><br><br>
		Ever since Nixon declared a war on drugs in 1971, drugs became a symbol of sociopolitical upheaval and scientific research on their medical potential was halted. However, in the process, the United States has reached its goal of becoming a nation with drug use declining to negligible levels. Or has it?<br><br>

Historically speaking, drugs laws have been passed when a large number of minorities have started using a specific drug. For example, a ban on cocaine was implemented after African-Americans started using it, and bans on opium and marijuana were drafted after an influx of Chinese and Latin-American immigrants. As a result of such laws, drug enforcement has been extremely strict and racially biased. After Congress passed mandatory minimum sentences for drug crimes in the 1980s, the federal prison population increased from around 25,000 to approximately 200,000 <a href="https://www.bop.gov/about/statistics/population_statistics.jsp">[1]</a>. In 2010, 28% of blacks and 33% of whites from age 18-25 years old had used marijuana in the past year; however, the arrest rate for marijuana possession in 2010 was 700 per 100,000 people for blacks and only 200 per 100,000 for whites <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/06/04/the-blackwhite-marijuana-arrest-gap-in-nine-charts/">[2]</a>. These policies have contributed to America having the highest prison population in the world, with about 3 in every 100 adults being under some sort of correctional supervision at the end of 2014 <a href="https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&iid=5519">[3]</a>.<br><br>

One of the underlying problems in America’s approach towards drug policy is its incorrect view of drug addiction. Many think that drugs by themselves are the sole reason for addiction, regardless of a specific individual and his or her background and current situation. This is wrong, as the famous rat park experiment and later psychological studies have shown. The rat park experiment compared the drug consumption by rats in different environments. One group of lab rats was confined to small, metal cages for each rat, while another group was allowed to live in a large, plywood environment constructed by the researchers to allow the rats to have recreation and social interaction. The rats pressed levers to inject morphine, a drug similar to heroin, into themselves. By the end of the experiment, it was clear that the rats in rat park preferred not to take the drugs and enjoyed a social life uninhibited by them. The rats confined in the cages consumed up to 19 times as much of the drug solution as the other group. This experiment revealed that individuals will generally choose not to abuse drugs if they have other aspects of life to look forward to and are not feeling isolated <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20130910-drug-addiction-the-complex-truth">[4]</a>. Although it is true that the rats in this experiment cannot be representative of the United States’ population, it does show that there is a socioeconomic aspect in addition to, if not more influential than, the biochemical aspect of addiction.<br><br>

Most efforts towards curbing the drug problem in America have been focused on lowering the supply of drugs by arresting drug traffickers and shutting off the production of drugs. The Drug Enforcement Agency has an annual budget of $30 billion yet only manages to stop the flow of 1% of drugs into and inside of the US <a href="https://mic.com/articles/93496/one-frustrating-statistic-proves-just-how-much-of-a-failure-the-war-on-drugs-has-been#.MRoT5ad2p">[5]</a>. This supply-side approach ignores a fundamental economic concept: supply and demand. Decreasing the supply of a product will drive a price upwards, and this will typically lower the consumption of that product; however, the demand for drugs is more inelastic and therefore is not significantly affected by price increases <a href="http://www.econlib.org/library/Columns/y2013/Powelldrugs.html">[6]</a>. While prohibition of substances does lead to a somewhat lower usage rate, the side-effects are much worse. This policy of attempting to reduce the supply of drugs then fuels corruption, the activities of gangs and cartels around the world, and political destabilization. These maneuvers lead to the recruitment of more traffickers as well as the employment of new ways to smuggle drugs, in turn keeping the drug supply stable <a href="https://www.tni.org/files/download/brief6.pdf">[7]</a>.<br><br>

Although most people think that drug decriminalization or legalization is too radical or utopian of an approach, several countries like Switzerland, Portugal, and Uruguay have adopted progressive drug policies and have seen positive results. These countries have all introduced legislation to decriminalize, legalize, and treat drug use like the public health issue, and not criminal issue, it is <a href="http://vancouver.ca/people-programs/four-pillars-drug-strategy.aspx">[8]</a>. If the United States adopted a drug policy which included decriminalizing certain drugs, distributing certain drugs under strict government regulation, and allowing more opportunities for addicts to seek treatment, not only would the US decrease its enormous budget on drug regulation in the chase of an unachievable goal, all of society would benefit. There would be a lower number of direct overdoses from narcotics, a lesser frequency in addiction rates and other diseases related to drug use, and a greater number of people who are actively contributing to society instead of financing their drug addictions or spending time incarcerated for non-violent drug offenses.<br><br><br>
