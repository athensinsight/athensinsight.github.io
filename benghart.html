	<h3><br>How Much Do You REALLY Know About Benghazi?</h3>
	<p>By Vaibhav Kumar - August 30, 2016<br><br><br>
		On September 11, 2012 a heinous invasion took place in Benghazi, Libya. Terrorists killed four innocent Americans and their tragic deaths were quickly used as fuel for partisan attacks. The Republican Party blamed Hillary Clinton, the Secretary of State at the time, for most of this horrendous attack. The misleading attacks by the Republican establishment on her “poor judgement” during the Benghazi attacks continue to increase exponentially during a very close election battle. The Republican Party founded much of their election platform this year on the mishaps of Benghazi. Chants like “lock her up” and other violent rhetoric directed toward Clinton are regularly spewed from Trump himself, his campaign, and his voter base. Most of these individuals are ill-informed on the topic due to continued polarization between parties and a lack of unbiased media representation from common right-wing news outlets such as Fox News, Rush Limbaugh, and the Sean Hannity Show. Surprisingly, much of the public remains in the dark when it comes to not only what took place in Benghazi, but also the role Clinton’s judgement played in response to the attack.<br><br>

At approximately 9:40 P.M local time, gunfire and explosions were heard as many armed civilians rushed through the main entrance. The intelligence team then informed Clinton about the attack twenty minutes after, while the Ambassador and others tried to find a place to hide. Sadly, Ambassador Stevens and Smith, the Information Management Officer, did not follow and were later pronounced dead. Around 1:00 A.M., a six-person security team reached to defend from further attacks. Throughout the night, the battle continued and intensified while Glen Doherty and Tryone Woods, two CIA contractors, were also pronounced dead during a short mortar attack. At 7:40 A.M. the first flight came to the warzone to pick up Americans and the second flight came shortly after at 10:00 A.M to get the remaining Americans.<br><br>

The response was full of sorrow in the states but abruptly turned into a blame game between the two opposed parties. The Republicans tried to find whatever they could do to gain political ground over the Democrats. Many questions had to be answered for the Republican constituency. “Was the Obama Administration aware of any threats before the attacks?” “Did the government try covering intelligence during Benghazi?”<br><br>

The Republicans got all the answers they so desperately desired on November 21, 2014, the day Clinton and the rest of the Democratic Party thought they would be set free from all the incessant political attacks on Benghazi. The Republican- controlled House Intelligence Committee released a comprehensive report responding to many of the essential questions surrounding the attacks. After ten Congressional committees, 13 Congressional reports with over 2000 pages in total, 33 Congressional hearings, and about seven million dollars spent, Congress found that there was neither evidence foreshadowing an attack in Benghazi nor was there an intelligence cover up.<br><br>

Do I need to repeat that the committee that released this exhaustive report was controlled by the Republicans?<br><br>

The media’s decision not to cover these reports has left the general public ignorant about important contentious issues that are used constantly as a point of attack by the Republican Party in this election. At any rate, swaying the staunch conservatives is a practically impossible task for anyone, but persuading the independents as well as slightly right leaning voters could be crucial to an election race that is getting closer and closer. The American citizens deserve to know Hillary Clinton’s and the Obama administration’s relationship with the Benghazi attacks because all the reports Congress has released would definitely come to a surprise for a majority of Americans.<br><br><br>
